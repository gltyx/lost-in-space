Unfortunately, this machine is less than one-hundred-percent effective, and some of the air is lost in the process. Additionally, a delicate nature of this machine only permits recharging it through the battery array.": "最后，揭示了一条可持续生活的道路。氧气发生器可以利用能量将航天服储罐中的二氧化碳再加工成氧气。不幸的是，这台机器的效率不是百分之百，而且在这个过程中，一些空气会流失。此外，这台机器的微妙特性只允许通过电池阵列充电。",

    "The Battery Room is a mess of broken stuff which looks far beyond repair. The whole section of the ship would need to be rebuilt from scratch, which requires properly modulating the energy field first. Some values are already fixed, while the others would need to be derived and imprinted into the ship's memory.": "电池室是一堆破烂不堪的东西，看起来根本无法修复。飞船的整个部分需要从头开始重建，这需要首先对能量场进行适当的调制。有些值已经固定了，而其他值则需要导出并印入飞船的记忆中。",

    "The door to the Enhancement Room is tightly shut, as it should be. The path forward is blocked by a combination lock which you unfortunately do not remember; the only thing you know that all numbers in it were different. You would need to come back with a bunch of Memory Cards and try to encode the correct sequence in order to pass. Thankfully, each rejection will provide some data to pinpoint the correct code better.": "增强室的门关得严严实实，这是应该的。前进的道路被密码锁挡住了，不幸的是你不记得;你唯一知道的是所有的数字都是不同的。你需要带着一堆存储卡回来，并尝试编码正确的序列才能通过。值得庆幸的是，每次拒绝都会提供一些数据来更好地确定正确的代码。",
    "The door to the Oxygen Room is locked using one of those old-fashioned mechanical locks for which you need an actual key. Unfortunately, the key is nowhere to be found. Fortunately, you do have a special robot that can pick mechanical locks, but it cannot be controlled manually and needs a set of guidance beacons to be placed beforehand. Another bot, this time controlled by you, should solve this problem entirely.": "氧气室的门是用老式机械锁锁上的，需要一把真正的钥匙才能打开。不幸的是，钥匙无处可寻。幸运的是，你确实有一个特殊的机器人可以打开机械锁，但它不能手动控制，需要事先放置一组引导信标。另一个机器人，这次由你控制，应该可以完全解决这个问题。",
    "The engine is completely wrecked. What is worse, the ion reactor that was feeding it is still active somehow, so it is completely unsafe to be on the other side of this triple-thickness door. Once again, a machine should help the man to overcome the difficulties, navigate the room full of debris and shut down the reactor. The exhaust from a working reactor disables any sort of communication, so the robot will need to be programmed in advance.": "发动机完全坏了。更糟糕的是，给它供能的离子反应堆不知何故仍然是活跃的，所以在这三层门的另一边是完全不安全的。再一次，机器应该帮助这个人克服困难，穿越满是碎片的房间，关闭反应堆。工作中的反应堆排出的废气会破坏任何形式的通讯，所以机器人需要提前编程。",
    "There are three sections that can be filled with water; in the beginning, only the first section is full, and other two are empty. You can transfer water between sections by using pipes; the transfer continues until either the input section is empty or the output section is full. This action costs Pipes equal to the number of decaliters transferred. Your goal is to fill the third section with exactly 1 decaliter of water.": "有三个部分可以装满水;开始时，只有第一部分是满的，其他两个是空的。你可以用管道在各个部分之间输送水;传输将继续进行，直到输入部分为空或输出部分已满。此操作消耗的管道等于转移的分配器数量。你的目标是用1分升的水填满第三部分。",
    "This room appears to have been flooded. There are automated systems that should be able to prevent this from happening, but it seems that they were overwhelmed by the sheer amount of incoming water. The system can still be tricked into activating, but that will require carefully balancing the water levels in the different sections of the room.": "这个房间好像被水淹了。有一些自动化系统应该能够防止这种情况发生，但似乎它们被大量涌入的水淹没了。该系统仍然可以被欺骗激活，但这需要仔细平衡房间不同区域的水位。",
    "This room is full with a soft hum of electricity flowing through the metal veins of this hulk of a machine. The Battery Array stores energy that can be supplied to any rooms connected to the ship-wide network, provided the Battery Array itself is connected.": "这个房间充满了柔和的嗡嗡声，电流流经这个笨重的机器的金属血管。电池阵列存储的能量可以提供给连接到全船网络的任何房间，前提是电池阵列本身连接。",
    "Though still in the process of fixing, this contraption can change the position of the ship in space favourably, which potentially leads to the increased energy production from some select stars. Those engines are also operational enough that you can find your way back to the civilization, if the Command Room is accessible.": "虽然还在修复过程中，这个精巧的装置可以改变飞船在太空中的位置，这可能会增加一些选定恒星的能量生产。这些引擎也足够运行，你可以找到你的方式回到文明，如果指挥室是可访问的。",
